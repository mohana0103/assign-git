What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
Gitignore file is a text file that intentionally specifies git to ignore untracked files.
Files already committed by Git are not affected.
Specific files might be system specific and need not exist on every system, few files contain sensitive data. All such files are ignored using gitignore.
Following should be included in gitignore file for a java project:

*.class

*.log

.mtj.tmp/

*.jar

*.war

*.nar

*.ear *.zip

*.tar.gz

*ar


What does fast forward mean in git mean?
The tip of your main branch is moved forward to the end of your feature branch using fast-forward merges.This cleanly integrates your feature branch back into your main branch while keeping all of the commits made in it sequential.
Why should we have different branches?
Each developer can separate their work from other developers' efforts by branching out from the original code base. It allows every developer in the team to work independently. 
In a project how many remote repositories do we usually need?
A project can have as many remote repositories that are need for the project depending on the complexity of the project. It helps in simultaneous development of the project.
